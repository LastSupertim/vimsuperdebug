# vimsuperdebug
Vim plugin to enable interaction between vim and lldb or gdb

Current state: early work in progress and experimenting.

This plugin is intended as a means to enable GDB or LLDB debugging within Vim. It indends to supply a visual component to debugging, analogous to what is seen in mainstream graphical debuggers.

This page will be updated once this plugin is ready for use.
